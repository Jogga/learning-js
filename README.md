# quest.js

I'm not a developer and I would like to learn some JS! So I'm just going for it; thinking up some projects and code away. This is the first of them: A little static site generator (heavily inspired by jekyll) for questjs.org, where I want to keep track of my JS-learnings.

Beware: this could probably be the messiest, most broken code you've ever seen. But I'm just beginning to learn and it's all work in progress ;)
