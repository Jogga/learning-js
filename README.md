# quest.js
===========

I want to learn how to code. I tried reading books and doing tutorials. To learn the basics. But somewhere along the way I always lost interest and didn't follow through with the current book or series of tutorials. 

Still I want to code.

Everyone I asked gave me the same advice: Think of a project and start working on it! Learn by doing! So that's what I'm going to do. Now.

On this Site I'll keep track of my progress. Here I'll write down my findings, conceptions and misconceptions. It's basically a my personal questlog, but If it helps anyone else I'd be even happier.
